Introduction to Project

This project involves the development of a robotic car and a gamified feedback system that communicates with the car. The purpose of the project is aimed for students ages 8-12 to have an exciting way to engage them with feedback in numerous different ways. The feedback system is expected to provide an interactive, simple and visual way for the students to identify the data of the robotic car using a web portal. Furthermore, the data(statuses) of the car should be simple to see on the web interface in a dashboard.
